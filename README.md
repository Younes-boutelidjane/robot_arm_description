# 3-Axis Robot Arm Description

This repository contains the URDF description of a 3-axis robot arm. The robot arm is composed of multiple links connected by revolute joints, allowing for articulated motion. Visual and collision properties are defined for each link, and joint specifications are provided to enable simulation in ROS (Robot Operating System) environments.

## Files

- **robot_arm.urdf:** The URDF file containing the description of the robot arm, including links, joints, visual and collision properties, as well as inertial properties.
- **frames.pdf:** A PDF file illustrating the frames of the robot arm, providing a visual reference for the coordinate systems of each link.

## Usage

To visualize the robot arm in simulation environments like RViz or Gazebo, you can load the URDF file using ROS tools. Ensure that you have ROS installed and set up properly on your system.
